# MapD
The OpenStreetMap based speed logical by the [Move Fast team](https://github.com/move-fast) and the [dragonpilot team](https://github.com/dragonpilot-community/dragonpilot)

The comma three uses regular SciPy. To have a better experience with mapd, please go to [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) to update and improve your area's data (i.e., Speed Limit, Stop Signs, Traffic Lights).
